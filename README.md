This repository demonstrates a common error in React: memory leaks caused by improper cleanup in the `useEffect` hook. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where a `setInterval` is started but never cleared. This leads to an interval constantly running, even after the component unmounts.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected version.  This is a crucial concept for building performant React applications, and this example provides a clear illustration of how to avoid such issues.
